<p>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
<p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</p>
